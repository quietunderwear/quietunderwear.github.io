Package: com.quietunderwear.rounddock
Name: RoundDock
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: Makes the dock round on non-notched devices using a bug discovered by NoisyFlake. I made this for myself because NoisyFlake's tweak allowed for 5 icons in the dock which I did not want on the small SE screen.
